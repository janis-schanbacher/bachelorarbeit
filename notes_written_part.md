## Klassisches (Traditionelles TODO Begriff) vs Agiles Vorgehen (Software Project Management)

## Agile Testing

Agile testing is managed differently than traditional testing.

Traditional testing happens after a build is completed. Test cases are defined early on. Most test runs are completed manually. If there are automated tests involved, those testing results are tracked manually too. Testers handle their work individually. Most importantly, traditional test plans are rarely reviewed or changed.

Agile testing happens continuously. Test cases are set based on user stories. As new user stories are added, new test cases should be added too. Testing is done in sprints, often utilizing test automation to increase test coverage. Most importantly, test plans are constantly reviewed and changed to meet changing needs.
